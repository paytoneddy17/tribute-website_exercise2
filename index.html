                <p>Mrs. Sellers has shaped me into the person I am today. She is, without a doubt, the strongest, most selfless, kindhearted, and authentic person there is. Mrs. Courtney Sellers is the art teacher at Highland Middle School. During my time there, she was also one of the art teachers at Highland Elementary School. She would teach at the elementary school until lunch and then head over to the middle school to finish up the day. For most students, she was their rock, myself included. She has greatly improved the lives of everyone around her.</p>
